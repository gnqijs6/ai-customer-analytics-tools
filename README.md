## FAQ

**How do embedded analytics platforms handle multi-tenant data isolation for SaaS applications?**

Purpose-built platforms like Qrvey and Explo provide native multi-tenant architecture with tenant-level data isolation, ensuring each customer sees only their data. Row-level security, customer-specific filtering, and isolated data storage prevent cross-tenant data leakage. Sisense and Power BI offer configurable security models supporting multi-tenant scenarios through careful implementation. Always verify that platforms provide proper tenant isolation controls before embedding analytics into customer-facing applications.

**Can we white-label these platforms to match our application's branding completely?**

Most embedded analytics platforms including Explo, Luzmo, Embeddable, and Qrvey support complete white-labeling with custom colors, fonts, logos, and domains. Sisense Compose SDK provides pixel-perfect UX control for seamless brand integration. Configure custom domains so dashboards appear on your URL rather than vendor subdomains. Some platforms like Looker and Tableau require higher-tier licensing for full white-label capabilities. Test white-labeling features during trials to ensure they meet your specific branding requirements.

**What's the typical implementation timeline for embedding analytics into our product?**

Lightweight platforms like Luzmo and Embeddable deploy in days to weeks with minimal coding required. Qrvey reports 10x faster implementation than building analytics in-house, typically completing in weeks rather than months. Enterprise platforms like Sisense, Tableau, and Looker require longer implementations spanning months due to complex data modeling and customization. Start with proof-of-concept dashboards using sample data, then expand to full production deployments. Developer-first tools like Embeddable accelerate timelines when engineering resources are available.
